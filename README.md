# ERIS

Epigenetic Robot Intelligent System (ERIS) is a psychologically-inspired, memory-based integrated epigenetic architecture for robot progressive knowledge development. ERIS ultimately aims to provide robots in general have the capability of exhibiting self-developing robot knowledge in a conceptually well-structured fashion for a long-term interaction with humans and the environment. ERIS also allows robots to possess personal experience and knowledge, that eventually yields in a more personalized and dynamic interaction with human.

**Tested in:**
